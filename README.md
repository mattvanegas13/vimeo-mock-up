This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
After cloning into the desired directory follow the instructions below

## To run this project

In the project directory run the following:

## `1. npm install`
  Install dependencies

## `2. npm start`
  To see individual components you can also run npm run storybook

Additional note: I was a little pressed for time but I am aware that one more thing I could do for the react app is to add PropType checking for components.
